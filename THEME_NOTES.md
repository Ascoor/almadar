# CaribeKS Upgraded Palette

This release migrates the application to the **CaribeKS Upgraded** color system.
All existing CSS variable names remain unchanged, but their values are updated
for improved harmony, accessibility, and dark mode parity.

## Usage
- Surface background: `bg-background text-foreground`
- Primary action: `bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90`
- Destructive action: `bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground`
- Muted text: `text-muted-foreground`
- Gradients: `bg-gradient-primary` or `bg-gradient-accent`

Refer to `src/styles/Tokens.mdx` for examples.
